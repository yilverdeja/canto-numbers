# Canto Numbers
A game to practice listening and understanding cantonese numbers. Number's can be said in a variety of ways and it's good to learn how to pick them up.

Besides whole numbers, I want to eventually add decimals, time, and other types of numbers in different categories.

Take 325. This can be said is 3, 2, 5. Or Three hundred and twenty five or with the contraction for twenty five.

## Tasks
- [ ] add numbers from 0 to 100
